Task 1
    Generate three sine signals using JSyn API with the following parameters and sum them together:
    - Frequency 1: 349
    - Amplitude 1: 0.63
    - Frequency 2: 3058
    - Amplitude 2: 0.68
    - Frequency 3: 5599
    - Amplitude 3: 0.37
    - Duration: 8
    A: Filter the top two frequencies out of the signal with the low-pass filter.
    B: Filter the lowest two frequencies out of the signal with the high-pass filter.
    C: Filter the only the middle frequency out of the signal with the band-stop filter.
    D: Filter the lowest and the top frequencies out of the signal with the band-pass filter.
Task 2
    In file media/siney.wav you have a song which has a narrow-band interference. Find out which is frequency of the interference in the song and use a notch filter to remove the interference.
    You can check the frequency spectrum of media/siney.wav by running FrequencySpectrum class.
Task 3
    Make a simple equalizer with the cascade of at least 8 FilterPeakingEQ filters.
